# Google Data Analytics Capstone: Cyclistic Bike-Share Analysis

## Project Overview
This is my capstone project for the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate. I'm taking on the role of a junior data analyst at Cyclistic, a Chicago-based bike-share company, working on the marketing analytics team.

## Objective
The marketing director wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. My analysis will help inform a new marketing strategy aimed at converting casual riders into annual members.

## Methodology
I'm following the structured six-step data analysis process:

Ask - Define the business question
Prepare - Collect and organize data
Process - Clean and transform data
Analyze - Identify patterns and insights
Share - Create visualizations and present findings
Act - Develop actionable recommendations


## Data Source
The trip data is downloaded from [Divvy Trip Data](https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html) (publicly available historical bike trip data provided by Motivate International Inc.).
